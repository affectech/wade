<p align="center">A proof-of-concept CLI tool to manage virtual machines with QEMU</p>
<br>
<br>

## Why?
I've been using raw QEMU on my Windows machine (yes, it's kinda odd) for some time and I've gathered a list of items I would like to have:
- [x] not to waste time searching for QEMU commands in my shells history just to boot a single VM
- [x] store my VMs as easy-to-find and readable configs.
- [ ] use QEMU's storage overlay feature

## How to use it
```
wade new
wade <vm-name>
wade <vm-name> insert <iso-image-from-your-downloads-folder>
```
