<p align="center">A proof-of-concept CLI tool for managing Virtual Machines with QEMU in a not-nerdy-config way</p>
<br>
<br>

## Why?
I didn't want to waste time in search of QEMU commands in my shell history to boot a single VM and also I wanted to store my VMs as easy-to-find-and-read configs.

## Use
```
wade new
wade vm-name
wade vm-name insert iso-image-from-your-downloads-folder
```

# Installation
